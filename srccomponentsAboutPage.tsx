        {/* OUR STORY */}
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2022 by a group of language‚Äëenthusiasts, RozmoWA grew out
          of the belief that language learning should be as natural as a
          conversation with a friend. From a single classroom in Warsaw we now
          serve learners in over 30 countries.
        </p>

        {/* OUR MISSION */}
